There are still some basic things missing in the current version, which needs to be done in feature versions. Here some features for the new versions:

===Trayicon===
  * Update the trayicon context menu, so that we can see the a VM is running.
  * Add Stop and Start to the context menu.
  * Add option to open console of the selected VM.

===Service===
  * Option needed to tell the service howto shutdown a VM. Default at the moment is savestate.
  * The service is not using all the new options of the current Windows version (like powersave etc). Implement all the new features.
  * Automatic assign VRDP ports to VM machines.
