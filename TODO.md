# TODO #
There are still some basic things missing in the current version, which needs to be done in feature versions. Here some features for the new versions:

### Trayicon ###
  * Update the trayicon context menu, so that we can see the VM is running (partial done in the BETA version).
  * ~~Add Stop and Start to the context menu.~~
  * ~~Add option to open console of the selected VM.~~

### Service ###
  * Option needed to tell the service howto shutdown a VM. Default at the moment is savestate.
  * The service is not using all the new options of the current Windows version (like powersave etc). Implement all the new features.
  * Automatic assign VRDP ports to VM machines.

### Need new features? ###
Just drop a feature request in the issues.
